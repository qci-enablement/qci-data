    "Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are a class of optimization problems where the goal is to maximize or minimize a quadratic objective function without any constraints on the decision variables. Furthermore, QUBO problems serve as fundamental building blocks for more complex optimization models that can address many real-world problems. This tutorial will go through why QUBOs are valuable, what they can do, and how to run such problems on QCi's Dirac entropy computing systems.\n"

    "## Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "QUBO encodings tend to naturally arise in quantum settings, or any setting where variable interactions are directly encoded into physical interactions between bits. The reason for this is that physical interactions tend to naturally be two-body, while most constraints in computer science problems do not. For this reason, QUBOs are a natural underlying model to think about when using a wide variety of quantum optimization systems. Since QUBOs are formally NP-hard, it is technically possible to map any optimization problem to a QUBO. Efforts have been made to do so efficiently. For example, [this work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-022-04634-2) expresses many common problems as QUBOs with the aim of bridging to quantum technology. QUBOs can be used to construct the kinds of linear constraints often found in optimization problems. Since automatic handling of such constraints is often very useful, we have also developed a related model called Quadratic Linearly Constrained Binary Optimization (QLCBO), which is documented in [this tutorial](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qlcbo-on-dirac). This lesson however will focus on using the underlying unconstrained model."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) defined by second order interactions between binary variables with no constraints, is defined by linear and quadratic terms, but since $x^2 = x$ when $x \\in \\{0,1\\}$, we can simplify the optimization expression as such $f(x) = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} J_{ij} x_i x_j$, where $f: \\mathbb{B}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Note that the coefficients naturally encode as a square symmetric matrix, so that $f(x) = x^T Q x$, where $Q$ has entries $Q_{ij}$. The goal of the optimization problem is to find the binary vector, $x^{*}$, that minimizes $f(x)$, \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `QuadraticModel` and `Dirac1CloudSolver`, this tutorial demonstrates a streamlined and modular approach to solving QUBO problems. The `QuadraticModel` abstract the encoding of the problem, while `Dirac1CloudSOlver` simplifies the job submission process to QCi's Dirac-1 device. This approach aligns with the modern practices for solving QUBO problems and extends the scalability of quantum-inspired optimization workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "For applications requiring constraints, a higher level of abstraction, such as QLCBO, might be more suitable. You can explore this approach in [our QLCBO tutorial](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/qlcbo-on-dirac).  If you feel confident with QUBOs and are interested in how they are applied without constraints, we encourage you to explore additional lessons linked above. However, if your application involves constraints, proceeding to the QLCBO tutorial would be the logical next step.\n",
