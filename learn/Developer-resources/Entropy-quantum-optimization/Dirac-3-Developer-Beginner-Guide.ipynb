    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac-3 is the latest addition to QCi's Entropy Quantum Computing (EQC) product line, a unique quantum-hardware approach for tackling hard polynomial optimization problems. Dirac-3 uses non-binary _qudits_ as its unit of quantum information (cf. binary qubits), where each quantum state is represented by $d \\geq 2$ dimensions. Dirac-3 can solve problems with variables beyond binary $(0, 1)$, including non-negative integers and sum-constrained continuous numbers. For further information on qudits, please read through the [Qudit Primer](https://learn.quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/lessons/qudit-basics) to better understand the benefits of high-dimensional programming. To delve deeper into the underlying physics of EQC technology, refer to our paper: [An Open Quantum System for Discrete Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04512).\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete-based variables allow Dirac-3 to solve a variety of important problems including integer-optimization problems with higher-order-polynomial objective functions. This tutorial provides an introduction to how to formulate such problems for Dirac-3 and run them as _jobs_ via QCi's cloud-based REST API. Dirac-3 is a stochastic solver that does not necessarily find the same solution on every run. Thus, the general approach is to use multiple runs per job to \"sample\" a solution space that we configure to be large enough to contain the global minimum (a.k.a., the ground state) we seek for the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: In order to begin running problems with Dirac-3 you will need to: \n",
    "- [Obtain an API access token](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/quick-start-on-cloud)\n",
    "- [Install qci-client (for Python)](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/tutorials-and-use-cases/quick-start-on-cloud#installation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Python language, the following code block initializes a `QciClient` client (from the [`qci-client`](https://pypi.org/project/qci-client/) package imported as `qci_client`) that connects to a Dirac-3 device via QCi's REST API on the cloud (at `url`). The `client`'s `get_allocations` method checks for a non-expired _access_ token from the API, and automatically retrieves/refreshes it when needed (using `api_token` as the _refresh_ token). (This is a common pattern across all of `QciClient`'s API-request methods.) A successful `get_allocations` call verifies both your authenticated API connectivity and your allocation time (in seconds) for running jobs on Dirac-3. Run this code block successfully (with `api_token` updated to your API token) before attempting to run the subsequent example problems."

    "## Polynomial Objective Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirac-3 solves objective-function-minimization problems over discrete spaces by searching for the ground state (i.e., lowest value) for the total \"energy\" of a potentially complex system with many variables with multiplicative interactions of different orders. Generally, this corresponds to finding the set of variables $x_i, \\: i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, N\\}$ that minimizes the energy $E$ returned by the following $N$-variable polynomial objective function up to degree five:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Dirac-3 allows direct submission for minimization only. It is assumed that users perform a simple transformation before submitting the problem to handle maximization (i.e., multiply coefficients by -1).

    "\n",
    "As long as the elements of `poly_coefs` and `poly_indices` correspond to each other in the encoding, the ordering of polynomial terms does not matter. Each index list in `poly_indices` should have a length corresponding to the maximum degree of the polynomial. The elements of each index list refer to the 1-based variable number, with repeats corresponding to a higher degree for that variable and zero(s) used to specify a lower degree term. All index elements must be non-decreasing from left to right, which ensures a unique representation of each polynomial term. Missing terms of a given degree are simply omitted from both lists, and multiple terms of the same degree are allowed and will be simply summed as indicated (e.g., the $5 x_1 x_2$ and $-6 x_1 x_2$ terms). The all-zero $[0, 0, 0]$ index refers to a degree-zero constant term (here $3.14$), which is normally omitted as it does not affect the minimization and is currently _not_ supported by Dirac-3."

    "#### Specifying Job Body Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "We now build the job body, selecting from the following configuration parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `job_type`: The type of job to be performed. In this case, ’sample-hamiltonian-integer’ indicates that the job minimizes a Hamiltonian with integer variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `job_name`: An optional user-defined string that names the job. Here, it’s set to ’test_integer_variable_hamiltonian_job’.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `job_tags`: An optional list of user-defined strings to tag the job for easier reference and organization. In this example, the tags are [’tag1’, ’tag2’].\n",
    "\n",
    "* `job_params`: A dictionary containing parameters for configuring the job's problem and device. The relevant fields generally depend on the choice of `job_type` and `device_type`, the latter of which must be present in `job_params` and here is ’dirac-3’. For ’sample-hamiltonian-integer’ on ’dirac-3’, the following `job_params` fields are relevant:\n",
    "    * `num_samples`: The optional number of samples to run for the stochastic solver. The value must be between 1 and 100, with default 1.\n",
    "    * `relaxation_schedule`: A configuration selector that must be in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, representing four different schedules. The relaxation schedule controls multiple parameters of the quantum machine including the amount of loss, number of feedback loops, the amount of quantum fluctuation, and mean photon number measured. While the first two parameters are fixed, the last two can be further adjusted by users (see below). Lower relaxation schedules are set to larger amount of dissipation in a open quantum system setup, leading to more iterations needed to reach stable states. As a result, the probability of finding an optimal solution can be higher in higher schedules, especially on a competitive energy landscape with the trade-off of longer evolution time. This parameter is optional with a default of 1.\n",
    "    * `num_levels`: An array of positive integers that defines the maximum possible value for each variable. For example, $[2, 2, 3]$ means $x_1$ and $x_2$ take two-level binary values 0 or 1 (qubit) and $x_3$ takes a three-level value 0, 1, or 2 (qudit). If each variable has the same upper bound, then an array with only a single value may be passed. The job will error if the total of `num_levels` over all variables exceeds the device limit (currently 954 on Dirac-3).\n",
    "    * `mean_photon_number`: An optional advanced configuration parameter that is normally set automatically through the choice of `relaxation_schedule`. A value specified here overrides the default value and should be a real-number value from 0.0000667 to 0.0066666. This parameter is the average number of photons detected over a specific time period which is a time-bin representing a possible value of a variable in Dirac-3. This is a common metric used in photon statistics and quantum optics to approximate the probability of being in the single-photon regime of coherent light. Low mean photon number maintains the quantum superposition effect in high-dimensional time-bin modes of the wavefunction. Notice that extremely low mean photon number to the same order of thermal or electronic noise in single photon detector might affect the solution negatively. [Fox, M. (2006). _Quantum Optics_.

    "    * `quantum_fluctuation_coefficient`: An optional advanced configuration parameter that is normally set automatically through the choice of `relaxation_schedule`. A value specified here overrides the default value and should be an integer value $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}$, which is used to compute the coefficient $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ in the real-valued interval $\\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}, 1 \\right]$. The inherent randomness of photon arrival time comes from the quantum nature of light giving rise to a fundamental limitation in single photon counting, known as Poisson noise. Dirac-3 takes advantage of this noise arising from quantum fluctuation to gain opportunity to large search space and jump out of local minima. This parameter can be adjusted to allow high or low amount of quantum fluctuation into the open system. A low fluctuation tends to provide a worse solution than a high fluctuation. Notice that, to maintain a good returned solution, this parameter should not reach too high in the same order as the signal photon. [[Bédard, G. (1967).

    "#### Specifying Job Body Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "We now build the job body, selecting from the following configuration parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `job_type`: Specifies the type of job to be performed. In this case, ’sample-hamiltonian’ indicates that the job minimizes a Hamiltonian with continuous non-negative variables obeying a sum constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `job_name`: An optional user-defined string that names the job. Here, it’s set to ’dirac_3_continuous_variable_example’.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `job_tags`: An optional list of user-defined string identifiers to tag the job for easier reference and organization. In this example, the tags are [’tag1’, ’tag2’].\n",
    "\n",
    "* `job_params`: A dictionary containing parameters for configuring the problem and the device. The relevant fields generally depend on the choice of problem and `device_type`, which must be present and here is ’dirac-3’. For this problem on this device, the following `job_params` fields are relevant:\n",
    "    * `num_samples`: The optional number of samples to run for the stochastic solver. The value must be between 1 and 100, with default 1.\n",
    "    * `relaxation_schedule`: A configuration selector that must be in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, representing four different schedules. The relaxation schedule controls multiple parameters of the quantum machine including the amount of loss, number of feedback loops, the amount of quantum fluctuation, and mean photon number measured. While the first two parameters are fixed, the last two can be further adjusted by users (see below). Lower relaxation schedules are set to larger amount of dissipation in a open quantum system setup, leading to more iterations needed to reach stable states. As a result, the probability of finding an optimal solution can be higher in higher schedules, especially on a competitive energy landscape with the trade-off of longer evolution time. This parameter is optional with a default of 1.\n",
    "    * `sum_constraint`: A constraint applied to the problem space such that the solution variables must sum to the provided value. Optional value that must be between 1 and 10000, with default 1.\n",
    "    * `solution_precision`: An optional number that specifies the level of precision to apply to the solutions. Omit this when the highest precision continuous solutions are deisired. If specified, then a distillation method is applied to the continuous solutions to reduce them to the submitted `solution_precision`. Note that `sum_constraint` must be divisible by `solution_precision` when the latter is specified.\n",
    "    * `mean_photon_number`: An optional advanced configuration parameter that is normally set automatically through the choice of `relaxation_schedule`. A value specified here overrides the default value and should be a real-number value from from 0.0000667 to 0.0066666. This parameter is the average number of photons detected over a specific time period which is a time-bin representing a possible value of a variable in Dirac-3. This is a common metric used in photon statistics and quantum optics to approximate the probability of being in the single-photon regime of coherent light. Low mean photon number maintains the quantum superposition effect in high-dimensional time-bin modes of the wavefunction. Notice that extremely low mean photon number to the same order of thermal or electronic noise in single photon detector might affect the solution negatively. [Fox, M. (2006). _Quantum Optics_.

    "    * `quantum_fluctuation_coefficient`: An optional advanced configuration parameter that is normally set automatically through the choice of `relaxation_schedule`. A value specified here overrides the default value and should be an integer value $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}$, which is used to compute the coefficient $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ in the real-valued interval $\\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{100}}, 1 \\right]$. The inherent randomness of photon arrival time comes from the quantum nature of light giving rise to a fundamental limitation in single photon counting, known as Poisson noise. Dirac-3 takes advantage of this noise arising from quantum fluctuation to gain opportunity to large search space and jump out of local minima. This parameter can be adjusted to allow high or low amount of quantum fluctuation into the open system. A low fluctuation tends to provide a worse solution than a high fluctuation. Notice that, to maintain a good returned solution, this parameter should not reach too high in the same order as the signal photon. [[Bédard, G. (1967).
